Any one person across teams trying to keep this all straight would surely fail.<p>Having done a lot of small git repos, I&#x27;m a big fan of one huge repo. It makes life easier for everyone, especially your QA team as it&#x27;s less for them to worry about. In the future, anywhere I&#x27;m the technical lead I&#x27;m gonna push for one big repo. No submodules either. They&#x27;re a big pain in the ass too.","time":1495644937,"type":"comment"}
