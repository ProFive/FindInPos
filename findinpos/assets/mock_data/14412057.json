It&#x27;s just a testament how <i>huge</i> are the codebases we&#x27;re dealing with (Windows over there, but also Android, and surely countless others), the staggering amount of code we&#x27;re wrangling around these days and the level of collaboration is incredible and I&#x27;m quite sure we would not have been able to do that (or at least not that nimbly and with such confidence) were it not for tools like git (and hg). There&#x27;s a sense of scale regarding that growth across multiple dimensions that just puts me in awe.","time":1495648693,"type":"comment"}
