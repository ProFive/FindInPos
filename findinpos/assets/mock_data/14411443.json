I know that both Google and Facebook use a huge mono-repo for literally everything (except I think Facebook split out their Android code into a separate repo?). So, all of Facebook&#x27;s and Google&#x27;s code for front-end, back-end, tools, infrastructure, literally everything, lives in one repo.<p>It&#x27;s news to me that Windows decided to go that route too. Personally, I think submodules and git sub-trees suck, so I&#x27;m all for putting things in a monorepo.","time":1495644768,"type":"comment"}
