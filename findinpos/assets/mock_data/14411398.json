I can imagine tools like Explorer, Internet Explorer&#x2F;Edge, Notepad, Wordpad, Paint, etc. all can stay in its own repository. I can imagine you can even further split things up, like a kernel, a group of standard drivers, etc. If that is not already the case (separate repos, that is), are the plans to separate it in the future?","time":1495644524,"type":"comment"}
