Why wouldn&#x27;t you want to break up the project into multiple repos for different parts of the system? That would let you work on and test each part independent of the rest. Each part should be able to function on its own, right? Of course some engineers would need to build and test the entire OS as a whole, but I&#x27;d wager that (for example) the team working on visual design of the settings app doesn&#x27;t need to have the source code of how the login screen verifies passwords.<p>Clearly Microsoft&#x27;s process works well enough for them, so I wonder what benefits there are to using the monolithic repo choice over many smaller repos.","time":1495644944,"type":"comment"}
